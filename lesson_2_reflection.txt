What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  It creates a .git folder, which is hidden in windows, that marks this
  directory as a repository. You need to do this because you can't just check
  random files into git, it also has a history of changes which is downloaded
  with it. This prepares your directory to be something that can be checked in.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  the staging area is a subset of the working directory that you intend to
  commit from the repository. This allows you to exactly control what you want
  to add, in case there is something in your directory you don't want to add.
  running git status shows you what changes  you are adding.
